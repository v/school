Regionalism, the PLO , and the Palestinians

PLO - Where does it come from? What kind of organization was it? Whose purposes does it serve?
	- Founded in 1964.

Nationalism - Where does it come from?

Palestinian Nationalist Organizations - PLO, Arafat

Palestinians were not very united in terms of which group they supported in the mid 1960s.

Why was there no effective Palestinian movement in the 1920s-1940s?
	- Fractured between local notables.

After 1950s, situation of the Palestine:
	- fractured community
	- stateless, landless, powerless
	- georgraphically displaced.
	- lost British support which was important regardless of not being that great.

In 1960s, when Arafat and PLO take over the Palestinian leadership, the nationalist movement turns as violent as it could have.
	- It didn't need to, but the fact that it does says something about the community.

Nasser in Egypt
	- didn't want to fight Israel.
	- wanted to get the British out of Egypt.
	- became the champion of ending British imperialism.
	- Suez War - 1956 - transformed Nasser's power at home, and in the Arab world.
		* expanded & sharpened his view of what the Arab world should be.
		* did not possess the firepower to win militarily against the Israelis or the British.
		* was still a big political victory.
	- Muslim Brotherhood was his political rival.
	- Great Orator - inspired the Egyptians.
	- was an ideologue
		* wanted to create a single political unit in which Arabs could coordinate socially, politically, and economically.
		* socialist - didn't like monarchies.

Nasser became the biggest rival for Israel
	- What does this mean?
	- Until the 1960s, he wanted to establish himself as the regional leader of the Arabs.
		* Just as concerned with regional wars as he was with Israel.
		* Does not seek direct conflict with Israel.
	- His political record is often interpreted by the 1967 war.
	- believed coordination among Arabs was the only path to protecting Egypt against the Israelis.
		* their inability to do so was the reason that Israel won in 1948.
	- 1958 (two years after the Suez war) - Nasser convinced Syrians to form one state called United Arab Republic.
	- UAR collapsed in 1961.
		* a group of Syrian military officers staged a coup and seceded.
	- What does this tell us about Arab unity?
	- he is a dictator.
		* not violent.
		* but will not tolerate political dissent.
	
Jordan River
	- Israel started building national water carrier in the 1960s to divert water into the lands for agriculture.
		* Syria and Jordan do the same thing.
		* Fears that this were going to spill over into another war.
		* Diplomacy in the US and all kept it peaceful.
		* Nasser called for Arab League Meeting in Cairo in 1964.
			- Establish common position on Israel.
			- called for cooler heads - avoid all military conflict.
			- showed himself as the leader of the Arabs.
			- called for creation of Palestine Liberation Organization.
				* seems to recommit himself to the Palestinian cause.
				* importance of Palestinian independence differ significantly between Arab states.
				* Nasser wanted to get Palestinians under his wing, so that they wouldn't attack Israel and bring Egypt into a confrontation.
				* would also make him more influential and power in the Arab nations.
				* deflects Syrian militarism.

The issue of the Arab Israeli conflict is used to deflect attention from a state's issues.
	- used to manipulate politics in the Middle East.

Ahmed al-Shuqayri - first head of the PLO - chosen by Nasser
	- authored the first PLO charter
		* emphasizing that there is such a thing as Palestinians.
		* They have a homeland.
		* They have been displaced.
		* No plan of action, nothing radical.
	- shows Nasser's priorities
		* no regional war.
		* no destruction of Israel.
		* no revolutionary intent.
	- PLO doesn't do very much.
	- doesn't improve refugees.
	- no clear political consequence.

Syrians suggested an alternative to PLO - Fatah - created by Arafat
	- independent of the PLO
	- stated aim was military action versus Israel.
	- revolution and armed struggle.
	- believed that his role in the organization was to accomodate all of its constituent members.
	- clearly understood why the Palestinian national movement failed.
	- Rejected the Arab league and Nasser's line for Arab unity had to precede Palestianian liberty.
	- Advocated the exact opposite.
	- 1965 - Fatah units from Jordan to raid into Israel.
	- published a newspaper Our Palestine distributed to refuuees.
	- dangerous development because of looming regional conflict.
	- Most of Palestinians did not support Fatah until after the war in 1967.
	- 1967-68 Fatah integrates into the PLO, and Arafat becomes the leader.
	- stronger commitmenet to nationalism than Nasser.
