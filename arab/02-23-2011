1948 - most important year in the history of the conflict.

Israel not only declares its independence in 1948, it shows through a civil and regional war that it is fully capable of defending it as well.
	- great deal of credibility.
	- faces security threats from immediate neighbors.
	- kicked out 150,000 non Jews.

There is no state of Palestine.

One narrative in 1948
	- A lot of Arabs that were in power in Israel decided to leave.
	- There was also a majority of Arabs that never had a choice.

Arabs were weak.
	- Arab armies did not stand a chance.
	- Arab factions were very divided with lots of fault lines.
		* Jordan's king wanted West Bank for himself.
		* Egyptian monarch was dubious about his army.
	
Palestianians have no friends
	- People become friends with them when it benefits their interests.

Since most Palestinians were refugees after 1948, let's look at what happened with them to learn more.
	- Most went to the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
		* Part of the reason why Palestinians today want to create a new state in West Bank.
	- Palestinians under Israeli occupation had it bad.
	- Palestinians under Arab states were, however, treated WAY more brutally.
		* Lebanon - Impoverished, subject to hostilities.
		* Jordan - No political rights, isolated communities, impoverished.

Arab neighbors declare war against Israel - May 1948.
	- Israeli organization - Hagana - Quasi-professional military.
		* stark contrast with Irgun, Stern Gang which were very grassroots, and local militia and terrorist.
	- December 1947
		* Hagana anticipated that there would be a conflict in the future because of the political vacuum.

Arab side of troops
	- More loosely organized collection of volunteers called the Arab Liberation Army.
	- Small number of veterans from the Great Revolt.
	- Large number of the Arab Liberation Army comes from outside the country - Iraqis, Syrians, Jordanians.
	- No centralized command, or rigorous training.
	- Arab national movement was very fractured.
		* Leaders usually cared about their own interests than everything else.
		* The Liberation Army is affected by the same problems.
		* World War 2 ended a lot of the problems that Arabs used to complain about.
			- Trade got better.
			- Socioeconomic improvements.
	- numbered around 10,000

United Nations declared that there would be an Arab state, and a Jewish state, but there will be no one on the ground to watch over.

What causes the spark? Why do the Hagana fight the ALI?
	- December 1947 - event took place in a Haifa oil refinery.
		* For much of the mandate, it operated with both Arab and Jewish laborers working side by side.
			- same unions
			- discussed labor concerns.
			- were generally friendly.
		* Member of the Irgun threw a bomb into the factory that killed 6 Arabs.
		* Sparks countrywide/mandatewide civil war.
		
	- Dier Yassin - massacre 120 kiled.
		* caused a lot of people to leave.
		* Arab radio broadcast and rebroadcast this event.
		* created anxiety among Arabs.

	- Between March, April, and May over 350,000 Palestinians fled.

Second stage of the war started the day after Ben declared independence.
	- Invasion did very little to improve Palestinian conditions.
	- By early June, there was a stalemate on the perimeter.
		* United Nations decalared a ceasefire.
		* Israelis rearmed instead.
		* By July 19th, they crushed the Arab armies and greatly expanded the borders of their nation.
	- Jordanian King Abdullah cooperated with Israelis to take over West Bank.
	- UN Parition plan - everything south of Nablus was supposed to be Arab.
