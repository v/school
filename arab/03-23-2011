	- changed the tenor of diplomacy and politics in the region.
	- arab leaders came to terms with this.
	- directly shape the terms by which the peace agreements will happen in the future.

Leads to the next Arab Israeli War - October 1973
	* Yom Kippur War


Land for Peace
	- Where did this idea come from?
		* Resolution 242 passed by the United Nations
		* It emphasized the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war.
		* frustrated by the war mongering going on in Israel.
		* Israelis, Egyptians, Jordanians, and Syrians immediately led their support to the resolution.
		* Why did it fail?
			- Israel held a lot of extra land including Egypt's national territory in the Sinai penninsula.
			- There is no clear stipulation of the territories that need to be given away by Israel.
			- Israel argues that if they withdrew from the Sinai Penninsula, they have fulfilled their duty according to Resolution 242.
			- Termination of all claims or states of belligerency and respect for and acknowledgement of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force.
			- There was no expectation of a peace treaty or a neecessity for the Arabs to talk to Israel.
			- Hence, there was no necessity that the Arabs acknowledged Israel's rights to their land.


Khartoum Summit 1967 - Nasser and Hussein
	- Since 1956, after Egypt scores a political victory in the Suez war, the Arab nationalist movement was at an all time high and believed that they would reconquer Jerusalem and Israel.
	- Even Saudi Arabia, who had historically opposed Arab nationalism, showed support for Nasser in the 1967 war.
	- attempted to suggest a diplomatic way forward.
	- Arab summit talked about 3 nos
		* No peace with Israel
		* No recognition of Israel
		* No negotiation with it
	- What did the Arabs intend in calling for international and diplomatic engagement?
		* did not say that they were willing to talk to Israel.
		* were willing to engage with international superpowers.
	- Where Resolution 242 was agreeable because it was ambiguous, Khartoum gave much more clear boundaries to Israel's withdrawal.
		* said that they could live with the state of Israel after 70 years of anti-Zionism.
		* accepted the reality on the ground.
		* With the exception of the PLO and Hamas, this is the position of the world.
	- Why did the statement contradict itself?
		* The Arab heads were from a bunch of different backgrounds - militant Arab nations in Iraq, oil nations in Saudi Arabia etc.
	- Did the Arabs recognize Israel?
		* De facto recognition - By using the name "Israel", they recognized its existence.
		* De jure recognition
	- Clear detemination in Israel that land acquired in 1967 even if it wasn't formally annexed, it would continue to be held. Why?
		* Security - establish a defensive perimeter around the Jordan River and Gaza
		* Ideology - attach a spiritual meaning to West Bank and emphasize that it should be made part of Greater Israel.
		* Future Leverage

 War of Attrition 1969, 1970
	- launched by Nasser to test Israel's resistance to holding their territory.
	- Would the Israelis be resilient enough?

Yom Kippur War 1973
	- established an early strategic advantage.
		* conquered a lot of Sinai.
		* Egypt's forces were pushed back on the West of the Suez Canal.
		* US intervened.
			- Kissinger shuttle diplomacy - flew from Damascus to Cairo to Tel Aviv everyday.
			- partial peace.
				* Sadat got land and US attention - exactly what he wanted.
				* The Israelis were initially worried about their existence at the end of this conflict.
			- in a strange way, the result of this war and the stalemate that followed was a separate peace will follow between Egypt and Israel.
				* giving up Sinai
			- as a result oil producing companies in the Middle East cut off supplies to the US.
				* directly led to the 1973 Oil Crisis, and turned oil into a political bargaining tool for the rest of the century.
