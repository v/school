1967 changes the nature of the conflict.
	- signals the beginning and the end of Arab nationalism.
	- Political Islam becomes increasingly important as a result.

PLO - founded by Nasser.
	
Fatah 
	- founded by Arafat
	- Movement for the Liberation of Palestine.
	- was marginal because Palestinians were poor.
	
Palestinian Refugees during this time
	- all their property was taken away.
	- guarded primarily by United Nations.
		* Egyptian and Jordanian militaries were only concerned with policing their borders and preventing an escalation of conflict.
	- were concerned with their political status.

1967 war shattered Palestinian faith that Arab neighbors would come to rescue them.
	- as much as they'd want to do the right thing . They'd never be capable of it.
	- Now was the time to take matters into their own hands. It was necessary for a home grown - locallly grown political network.
	- Once this becomes a prevailing sentiment among Palestinians, we begin to see a convergence of existing organizations and movements.
		* Fatah will become increasingly popular in the eyes of the Palestinians - because they see it as the only option for Palestinian liberation.
		* PLO will be taken over by Fatah.

Karameh 1968
	- Fatah military members were here.
	- attacked by Israel.
	- caught the 300-900 Palestinian militia entirely by surprise.
	- fought off Israelis successfully - something that the Arab armies around them could not do in the last two decades.
	- becomes a mythical phenomenon for the Palestinians.
	- reverses their expectation and approach to thinking about politics.
	
Lesson in 1967 was that Israel was vastly superior militarily.

The embrace of violence in the Palestinian national movement happens in 1967, and there are clear reasons for that - it becomes the only option left on the table.

PLO became an umbrella organization more than anything else.
	- These sub-organizations mostly served interests of their own elites.
	- even though it represents radicalism and violence, it doesn't necessarily mean that it's a well oiled machine. 
	- None of the members of the PLO came from West bank or the Gaza strip. All of them came from regufee camps outside.
	- Arafat played an important role in the organization.
		* not paricularly charmismatic.
		* couldn't command a room like Nasser could.
		* was a consensus builder. Negotiated behind the scenes.


		
Dawson's Field Hijackings September 1970. 
	- members of the PLO hijacked planes and landed them in Jordan.
	- made relations between Jordan and the rest of the world strange.

Revolution Airport

PFLP was especially provocative.
	- called for the overthrow of King Hussein even though they were in Jordan.
	- blew up the hijacked planes that were at Dawson field.
		* launched an attack on the Palestinians that killed over 50000 people.
		* The very next day Syria invaded Jordan to aid the PLO.

Cease fire Meeting 1971

Palestinians made a switch to terrorism
	- massacred Israeli elementary school students.
	- their goal became the destruction of Israel.
	- should the PLO be considered successful?
