Land Settlements after 1967

Palestinian point of view - If there was no Israel, there would be no terrorism/militants in the Middle East.

Israeli settlements withdrew from the Gaza Strip in 2004.
There are around 500,000-600,000 people that live in settlements around East Jerusalem in the West Bank.
There are around 2.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank.

There is no single Israeli position on the territories.
	- Most Israeli policymakers would agree that it is within Israel's interests to dismantle the settlements within the West Bank.
	

Why are the Israelis still holding on to this land?
	- Provides a buffer zone from Jordan. Israelis don't trust the Palestinian insurgents.
	- Religious attachment - there is a spiritual meaning to these places. Not just Jersulaem, but the West Bank as well.
	- Social Structure in Israel is unequal.
		* Israel is very diverse in terms of ethnicities of Jews.
		* There is a social hierarchy established, and implicit discrimination, much like in the United States and Western Europe.

Strategic of the West Bank,	
	- One of the key objectives of Israeli politics was to secure a more thorough control over Jerusalem.
	- In 1950, the Israeli Knesset declared Jerusalem to be the capital of Israel retroactively.
	- The first settlements were created as a defensive perimeter and as a military buffer against the Jordians or the Palestinians.
	- In the immediate aftermath of the 67 war, the settlments did not have muchi to do with the ideology of Jerusalem.
