The Second Intifada

Much of where Palestinians are today is dictated by what happened immediately after Camp David 2.
	- Within a couple of months, there was an escalation of violence.
	- By mid summer 2000, Oslo was virually dead, and the failure of Camp David sealed its fate.
	- The Second Intifada erupted until 2004-5.
	- defined by the internal structure of the Palestinian community.
		* competing ideologies - Hamas & Fatah.
	- IN the eyes of Palestinians, it became clear that Israel was not interested in removing its settlements.
	- There was rising Israeli pressure on Barak.
		* Even though he yielded nothing at Camp David, people saw him as symbollically giving up ground.
		* He had not only not produced anything but he had raised expectations among Palestinians and other folks.
		* There began to be a power struggle inside Israel that would reshape the nature of the conflict.
			- marked the ascendance of Ariel Sharon.

Ariel Sharon
	- became a particularly controversial figure in 2000-1.
	- Once Sharon becomes the preferred choice, it becomes very clear that not only is Oslo dead, but that there is also going to be an era of violence.
	- His legacy
		* In the 1950s, he was the leader of Unit 101 that massacred civillians.
		* He was the architect of the Lebanon invasion in 1982.
		* Sabra and Shatila.
		* He was responsible for the settlement policy in the 1990s.
	- Is it possible to deconstruct Israeli settlements in the West Bank?
	- visits Holy Sites in Jerusalem in September, 2000.
		* guarded by 1000 security guards.
		* denied permission by Barak.
		* went anyway.
		* This event stirred up Palestinian violence, which demonstrated a security threat resulting in a political victory.
			- elections coming up in 2000-1.
			- protests took place in the Gaza Strip as well as the West Bank.
			- IDF responded with live ammunition.
				* not the usual way Israel handled "crowd control".
				* "break their bones" policy during the First Intifada.

The Second Intifada
	- 2000-4 ~5000 Palestinians, 1000+ Israelis killed. Thousands wounded.
	- Who was responsible?
		* Arafat no more responsible than Sharon himself.
		* 2001 Mitchell Report
			 - absolves Arafat and the Palestinian authority.
			 - The decision by the IDF to use lethal means against the Palestinians caused the Intifada.
		 * Arafat did nothing to prevent the demonstrations & the violence that was part of the Intifada.
		 * If Arafat wasn't calling the shots, who was?
			- Hamas?
			- Coming off over half a decade of achieving nothing, the PLO, Fatah, and Arafat had lost a lot of credibility.
			- Hamas and Islamic Jihad became more active in the 1990s.
			- Wings of the PLO - PFLP, Secular Organizations embraced the tactics used by Hamas and Islamic Jihad - suicide terrorism.
				* do as much damage to Israelis as possible.
	- Israel retaliated with its own violence.
		* Over 30 targeted assassinations.
		* no concern for collateral damage (Apache helicopters vs sniper on rooftop)
		* perpetuated the idea that there was a collective price to pay (home demonstrations).
		* The construction of the bypass roads and military checkpoints was intensified.
		* Sharon was elected as a result of the stunt.
		* In 2002, he ordered that the Gaza Strip and the West Bank be carved up with these checkpoints.
		* Closed off trade with Palestine.
		* In the aftermath of 9/11, the threat of suicide bombings was the reason for their increasingly intensified response.
	- Huge emotional toll on both communities.
		* the month after month continuation of violence.
		* embraced terrorism as a tactic to punish the other side.
		* make the cost of occupation so high that the Israelis have to leave.
			- Hizbollah did this in South Lebanon.
	- furthered Sharon's campaign of needing to stay in the West Bank, and continuing to engage Palestinians militarily.
		* announced plans in 2002 to build a separation barrier between Israel and the West Bank.
			- prevented would be attackers from getting in to the country.
		* provided short term security but accelerated tensions.
			- annexed lands in the West Bank "by default "
	- The Intifada ended when Hamas declared a truce in 2005, and Israel decided to withdraw from the Gaza Strip
		* seems to suggest that the Palestinians got a significant concession as a result of the Intifada.
		* If Sharon didn't want to give up land, why did he leave Gaza?
			- solidified settlements in the West Bank as a result.
			- It was not a concession to Palestine - land was not fertile, no ecoonomic advantages.
			- The Israeli military suggested that the violence on the ground was unjustifiable.
				* most powerful critique of Israeli's Gaza campaign.
				* Sharon understood this.
			- was also receiving signals from George Bush that indicated that both sides had to make painful concessions.
				* This would put the pressure on the Palestinians to do something about it.
			- instead of performing this bilaterally, he did it all alone.
				* relieved political pressure.

Operation Cast Lead
	- Hamas took over the Gaza Strip in 2007, after winning a democratic electoral victory.
	- Continued violence between Israel and the radical Islamic groups.
	- Has this signaled the death of the two-state solution?
