Beginning of an Arab-Israeli Conflict

Tried to make peace with neighbors after war ended.
	- Discussions b/w Arab and Israelis always stumbled upon refugees.
	- Arabs also suggested 1947 partition plan but Israelis disagreed.

Israel found itself in a hostile environment.
	- Egypt refused to permit ships through Suez.
	- Jordanian infiltrators attacked all the time.
	- Ben Gurion suggested an aggressive stance on this issue - retaliated to prevent future attacks.
		* didn't really help negotiations.

Israel was also divided within itself like Pre 1948 Zionists.
	- Mapai was the dominant party, and remained established till 1967.

Israeli Government
	- strong cabinet.
	- never adopted a constitution.
		* would limit governmental powers, and identify boundaries of the state.
	- religious communities had their own courts.
	- Jews had priority in citizenship over Arabs.
	- Ben Gurion disbanded Irgun and parts of the Hagana immediately after 1948 because their members were derived from rivals.
	- saw themselves as home of all Jews not just the Jews in Israel.
		* Jewish population doubled because of this, and pressures from neighboring Arab states.
		* caused economic pressure.
	
Israeli Arabs
	- mostly lived in military zones near armistice lines.
	- lands became absentee - seized by Israeli custodians.
	
Palestinian Refugees
	- Most went to West Bank/Jordan, became citizens.
	- A lot of them still lived in camps funded by the UN.
	- 200k went to Gaza Strip under Egyptian rule.
	- Syria had territory to house refugees, and tried to talk to Ben Gurion, but he refused.
