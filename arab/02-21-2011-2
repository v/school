May 14, 1948: Israeli Independence

White Paper 1939
	- Ended support for the creation of a Jewish national home
	- Caps on immigration
	- British control over land purchases
	- Ultimate goal the creation of a unified state
		* With Arab interests ultimately determining the fate of immigration

For the Arabs and Jewish community in Palestine, WW2 was consequential
Arab community was doing better after WW2
	- Their social lives
“We shall fight the war against Hitler as if there were no White Paper, and we shall fight the White Paper as if there were no Hitler”
Caps on immigration policy from 1939-WW2 were successful
By the end of WW2, only 82,000 Jewish immigrants in total migrated to Palestine
The Last Jew in Vinitsa, 1941
	- 28,000 Jews in Ukraine town of Vinitsa were massacred by Nazis
 
Patria, Black Sea, 1940
Struma, Istanbul 1942
S.S. Patria: placed in Haifa, loaded with 1700 illegal immigrants who were going to be deported to Mauritius. Bomb went off and killed almost 800 people onboard. All of them happened to be Jews escaping violence in Eastern Europe
Zionists were outraged by this, and blamed the British
 
David Ben-Gurion
	- first prime minister of Israel in 1948, replaced a much different kind of Zionist politician
	- Before him, Zionism had been dominated by more conservative officials
	- Challenged Zionist politics, opposed the Partition Plan (2-part sate, one Arab, one Israeli state, supported by Weizman)
 
Biltmore Program
	- Would sharpen, and clarify precisely with the emerging group of Zionists would come to expect an accepted political outcome: what they want, and how they would go about it
	- Called for a Jewish commonwealth in all of Palestine (more of national identity than it is of faith)
	- Those who attended the Biltmore Program expected all of Palestine, whereas the old generation of Zionists (Weizman) expected much less, through Partition Plan
 
Irgun
	- Revisionist Zionism put through by Jabotinsky
	- Created in 1936
	- Advocated terrorism against Arabs during Great Revolt
	- Frustrated with British after 1939 White Paper
	- Most members considered Nazis a great threat, but not all of them
	- Stern Gang created in 1940
	- Irgun ultimately joined forces with Stern Gang in 1943
 

Abraham Stern

	- founded Stern Gang
	- so frustrated with British policy and even talked with some Italians and Germans because they as well opposed British
	- killed by British in 1942
	- many leaders of Stern Gang were imprisoned
 
Both groups demanded all of Palestine become Jewish state
British sent 80,000 troops to Palestine to crush Zionist revolt
Military campaign lasted about 7 months
British after war were $13.3 million in debt

 
1946- Irgun blow up British headquarters in Palestine and King David Hotel
Initially, the British responded by wanting to oppress
But within 6/7 months, the British jumped the question of Palestine onto the UN
UN Commission, the UN Special Committee on Palestine, made up of representatives from 11 nations, in 1947, called for the termination of the Mandate, and called for Arab and Jewish states, Jerusalem being an international zone
	- By the time the UN came to voting the recommendation, both Zionists and Arabs knew that there would be no one around to endorse it
	- It would essentially come down to which nation would be able to pursue its interests more successfully
	From December until May 1948, there was an emerging civil war between Arabs and Zionists occurring on the ground
	- A struggle, determining who would assume direct control of Palestine
	US President Truman shocked his government (because there was no consensus on what to do for Palestine), declared US recognition for the state of Israel, bestowing upon immediate political credibility
	- That same day, May 15, Syria, Jordan, and Egypt invaded Egypt and there were 2 Arab-Israeli wars
	- The consequences of all this would be dramatic
		* It would be catastrophic for Arabs and Jews living in Israel
		* Greatest national tragedy
		* This event will be important for which of the rest of 20th century will take shape
