Land for Peace Outline

Question:   Since the 1967 war it has widely been accepted that the best formula for achieving a peaceful resolution to the Arab-Israeli conflict has been “land for peace.”  Yet the idea of land for peace has failed to yield a stable and enduring peace between Israelis, Palestinians, and neighboring Arab states. Why has the land for peace formula failed? What are the forces that have derailed it? In your answer, be sure to address the following questions: what are its origins? Have the various actors consistently embraced the idea in theory and in practice? Is land at the heart of the conflict or are other (ideological, religious, etc) forces at work?
 
Why has it failed?
	- There's people on both sides of the conflict that believe that peace is not only unachieveable but also undesirable.
	- Violence on both sides of the conflict as opposed to peaceful negotiations.
	- People refusing to acknowledge each other unless preconditions are met. Example: Bush not wanting to talk to Palestinian Authority unless Arafat resigned etv.
		* Khartoum - no peace no recognition no Israel.

What are the forces that have derailed it?
	- Internal conflicts within Palestine - Fatah and Hamas fighting each other.
		* lack of a clear leadership.
	- Internal conflicts within Israel - Likud vs Rabin/Barak.
	- Election of what's his face in 2000.
	- Lack of trust between the two groups.
	- They have to put the religious forces behind.
	- Acknowledgement that peace is the best for both nations.

What are its origins?
	- Resolution 242
	- Deal made in 1979 with Sadat & Egypt.

Have the various actors consistently embraced the idea in theory and in practice?
	- Nope.

Is land at the heart of the conflict or are other forces at work?
