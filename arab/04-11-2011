Oslo Accords
	- 1992-3 - meetings in Norway
	- First time Palestinians and Israelis met face to face.
	- Made a peace agreement - Oslo Accords
	- By 2000 the Oslo Accords had failed.
		* Didn't fail because people were earnestly interested in pursuing a resolution.
		* didn't fail completely.
		* failed to produce stability
		* In both factions, there were people that believed, and were deeply invested in the idea that peace was unreachable, and undesirable.
	- Timeline
		* Right after the Gulf War against Saddam.
		* US sponsored a peace conference in Madrid in October 1991. US made a commitment (unprecedented), for Israelis and Palestinians as well as with representatives of Jordan to meet for terms of a potential peace.
			- Not the PLO.
			- Intifada was in 1991.
		* What made US want to seek for peace?
			- We never made a serious effort in the past. (always pro-Israel)
			- Soviet Union collapses in 1990s.
				* no balance of power game
			- First Gulf War was a huge coalition of forces that responded to a United Nations statement.
			- 1991 is in many ways the height of the Intifada.
		* Why did Israelis go to Oslo?
			- 60% support for Oslo
				* Iron Fist in 1980s - why did this change?
				* The international opinion changes because of the Intifada.
				* Anxieties about Hamas don't start until after Oslo.
					- They believed that the Communists (PLO) were a bigger threat than Islamists.
				* Likid made a commitment to not make an agreement with Palestinians.
			- Yitzak Rabin ran on a platform that he would reverse Likud policies and cooperate with the Palestinians.
		* Why did Palestinians go to Oslo?
			- PLO perceives that it is losing the battle against Hamas. 
			- Intifada spinning out of control
			- PLO was invited to Oslo.
	- What was in it?
		* Two parts
			- Mutual Recognition
			- Declaration of Principles.
		* PLO
			- Arafat acknowledges Israel.
			- embraces all of the ideas that Israel would want to see accommodated.
			- conceded a lot of ground to Israelis.
			- was Arafat sincere?
		* Israel
			- officially recognized PLO as an organization and as the representative of the Palestinian people.
	
	- Declaration of Principles
		* Withdrawan of Israelis from Gaza and parts of West Bank within three months.
		* Palesinian Representative Council to figure out the kinds of Palestinian government.
		* Confidence building measures ^
		* Final Status Negotiations - big issues left for later.
			- Jersulasem
			- Security
			- Right of return for Refugees
			- Settlements
		* Why were the negotations approached this way?
			- Until the PLO organized itself, it doesn't make sense to make serious negotiations.
			- Israelis feel like they have leverage, that they don't necessarily want to give up.
			- Build political confidence among Israeli and Palestinian groups.

	- Why did it fail?
		* By deferring on the most important issues, it created too much time.
		* Between 1993 and 1993, radicals on both sides stepped in and undermined the process altogether
			- 70 terrorist attacks carried out by Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and PFLP.
			- Israeli violence against Palestinians became much tougher and savage in the mid 1990s (even moreso than the 1980s).
			- In 1995, Yitzak Rabin was assassinated by an Israeli radical.
				* Because he was giving "Our Land to the Palestinians".
			- In 1996, a guy from the Likud was elected Prime Minister who ran a platform of anti-Peace and reciprocity for Palestinians.
			- Hamas became increasingly violent and radicalized.
				* undermined the peace process at all costs.
				* destroying the PLO and destroying Israel.
				* Suicide bombings.
			- By the year 2000, there was a new level of anxiety on the ground in Israel and Palestine.
