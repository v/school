Intifada  1987-1993
	- started off as civil disobedience.
	
Car accident
	- Palestinians thought that it was purposefully done by the Israeli military.
	- Retribution for murder of Israeli businessmen.
	- it was believed to be true in Gaza and the West Bank
	- Riots erupted within the Palestinian community.

Intifada marked another turning point.
	- Grounded the conflict once again in the territory of Israel and Palestine.
	- From the early 1990s, with the exception of Saddam Hussein targeting Israel in 1991, and Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 2006, all the events take place in the West Bank and Gaza.
	- In addition to shaping and reshaping the substance of the conflict, this particular moment also profoundly shapes the perception of it.
	- If the terrorist activities in the first part of the conflict shows the Palestinian stance as being unacceptable, the Intifada redefines this.
		* There is an influx of Palestinian sympathy everywhere in the world.
		* Even the United States calls for the creation of a Palestinian state.
	- While it may have been a moment of hope and possibility, it ultimately doesn't do very much.

Backdrop
	- PLO, the head of the Palestinian National movement, is located in Tunisia (North Africa), 1500 miles away.
	- Regional powers are turning away 
		* Jordan's King Hussein washed their hands with the conflict.
		* Egypt signed a separate peace with Israel in 1979, and were brought back into the Arab League.
		* But they were preoccupied with dealing with Saddam Hussein lauching a war on Iran. (1980-88)
	- The Arab Israeli conflict is put on the backburner. The Arab states are preoccupied with other affairs.
	- By 1987, there was no aspect of life, no sector of the Palestinian economy, that remained untouched by the occupation.
	- Over the course of 20 years, the Israelis had intruded upon Palestinian life in every way they could.
		* created difficult cirumstances for the Palestinians.
	- The pace and number of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza strip accelerated.
	- There was a bunch of restrictions placed on the Palestinians in addition to the occupation of land by Israelis.
		* Carved out lands that were reseved for Israeli activites.
		* Whether this was justified or not, it placed a lot of pressure on the average Palestinian.
	- Palestinian point of view - No state, no effective political leadership, no arab states that care about you, cumbersive and oppressive occupation in the West Bank (like it will become later on).
	
Gaza Strip's population density is 11,000 compared to the NJ density population of 1,100.
	- refugee communities after 1948.
	- Egyptians allowed Palestinians to enter.

Intifada will come to represent the voice of the youth of Palestinian settlers.
	- They didn't know anything other than Israeli, Jordanian, Egyptian oppression.

From the early 1980s, the Likud leadership started an "Iron Fist" policy.
	- harsh tactics to manage Palestinian settlements.
	- collective responsibility/punishments.
	- mass detentions.
	- deportations, school closings.
	- punishing all Palestinians for the perceived crimes of the few.
	- None of these suggested that the intifada was inevitable, or that violence was imminent.

Intifada went on for 5 years.
	- Remarkable considering Egypt and Mubarak.
	- Leaderless at first. How did it last as long as it did?
		* There would emerge, atlesat in the initial stages, a very clear leadership.
		* Well organized, well planned, and well coordinated.
		* Routine emerged with the divison of labor.
			- One group was responsible for an economic boycott.
			- Another resopnsible for marches or demonstrations
		* Institutions began to take shape, and it becomes bureaucratized, in which local leaders discipline people on a local level.
		* Stark change from the 1960s/1970s. Local elites formed an alternative political leadership to the PLO.
			- worked better than a centralized leadership because you could understand your shopkeeper down the street better.
			- gave people a better understanding of the Palestinian movement.
		* Many young Palestinian men assumed the responsibility of putting up resistance against the Israeli occupation.
			- were also responsible for enforcing the boycotts, distrubuting leaflets, doing logistical work on the behalf of local leaders.
	- It is easy to look at the Intifada and say that this was a noble revolt in response to continual oppression from the Israelis.
		* Atleast in the early years.
		* It became increasingly complicated
		* Kids were doing the dangerous work of policing one another.
			- made sure people adhered to local leadership.
		* There was a police component in the Palestinian community that caused internal violence, and torture.
		* Had it's ugly sides as well.

Israel
	- Yitzhak Rabin - defense minister in 1980s
		* believed in the Iron Fist.
	- One of the principles that a lot of people believed was that Arabs only understood force.
		* Comes from Revisionist Zionism/Iron Wall.
	- If we think that's actually true, why haven't the palestinians learned their lessons?
	- In 1988 to the NY Times, Rabin said "might power and beatings" will cow the Arabs. Troops were sent to "break the hands of Young Arabs" so they could not throw stones.
		* provocation.
	- The most important function of the Intifada was not so much the strategic otr tactical objectives, but it was the theater of rebellion in the West Bank and Gaza.
		* There might be something significant here.
		* How can you claim this when there were lives lost and the world didn't care about Palestine.
		* Presents a huge appeal to the international audience.

An essential part of the Israeli narrative has been that Israel is a small country dealing with attacks from everywhere around it.
	- always played the underdog card.
	- Intifada reverses the tables on them.

Who led the Intifada
	- United National Leadership of the Uprising (UNLU)
		* emerged in Jan 1988?
		* recognized the authority of the PLO, but the reality was that the PLO was far away.
	- PLO
		* would eventually infiltrate the West Bank and Gaza strip.
	- Hamas
		* was founded after the outbreak of the uprising.

The Intifada begins to crumble by the early 1990s.
	- started off with one set of objectives, and withered as a result of the fractured nature of Palestinian leadership.
	- Over 150 Israeli soliders were killed, and thousands of Israelis were injured.
	- Lots of Israelis became frustrated with the Iron Fist policy, and began to sympathize with parts of Palestinian ideology.
	- Was the cost of the creation of 1967 territories too high?
		* Moral terms and political terms.
		* Did Intifada etc. further threaten Israeli security.

	- Palestinians paid a high price as well.
		* Around 1000 people killed.
		* Significant number wounded.
		* pattern emerged whether Palestinian dissidence was conditioned to imprisionment and torture.
		* limits placed on ability of Palestinians to move freely by the early 1990s.
		* In the midst of all of this, it is difficult for business, trade, work to go on as normal. Further economic depravation resulted.
	- Ends with an agreement signed between Israel and PLO called the "Oslo Accords".
		* marked the official end of the first Intifada.
	- Also changed the fundamental character of the Palestinian national movement
		* 1987 - Ahmed Yassin - founded Hamas.
		* outgrowth of the Gazan branch of the Muslim brotherhood.
		* created because Yassin and supported believed that the PLO was becoming soft, and disinterested in recreating historic Palestine.
		* believed that the PLO would settle for less than 1948.
		* The movement for Islamic resitance.
		* Means "Zeal".
		* wanted to build an Islamic state in Palestine unlike the PLO.
			- raised questions for Palestinians.

Hamas
	- has a sense of history, always thinking about 1948.
	- They don't look to Arab nationalism, Arafat, or Nasser.
	- Hamas al Qassam Brigades is the military of the Hamas.
		* al-Qassam was a Syrian price that launched a revolt against the British mandate to trigger the 1937 revolt.
	- this interpretation of Islam isn't dominant among Palestinians.
