May 14 1948 - Israel was independent. First Prime Minister >Van Gurian< made a declaration with the help of the United Nations General Assembly.
	- this is only a decade after the British White Paper that undermined Zionist objectives
		* limited immigration.
		* made Arabs the leaders of a unified state.
		* British control over land purchases.
		* ended support for a Jewish national home.

How do we get from the 1939 White Paper to Israeli independence?
	- Great Revolt - was this against the British?
		* Arab revolt against the British
		* The "Arab revolt" in Palestine, or "The Great Uprising" took place between 1935-6 and 1939. It  consisted of a strike including withholding of taxes, of acts of sabotage against British forces, assassination of British officials, murder of Jewish civilians and murder of other Arabs. The revolt was triggered by Arab dissatisfaction and alarm at the relatively large number of Jewish immigrants arriving in the early 1930s, worsening economic conditions due to the world depression and other factors, and disaffection stirred up by the Husseini clan.
	- British left mandate Palestine.
		* there was a LOT of violence on the ground.
		* their priorities were changing - WW2.
		* they wanted to secure a holding in North Africa from Algeria to Egypt.
			- as opposed to the focus on the Middle East in WW1.
		* specter of German dominance seemed unstoppable.

World War 2 was also consquential for Arabs and the Jews.

Great Revolt dominated Palestinian politics.

Arabs were actually doing better socioeconomically during World War 2 than they were in mandate Palestine.
	- Their lands were displaced after WW1.
	- There was a lot of change going on in a very short amount of time.
	- There was growth in demand for Palestinian grown food.
		* European products were no longer available.
		* Free trade

It still wasn't a pretty picture though.
	- Continued to feel anxiety about being an imperial colony, and being taken over by the Zionists. 
	- Wanted to reverse the trend of Zionism, and the influx of immigrants.
	- There were no significant organizations that represented the Palestinian Arabs.
		* There was a lot of factionalism - disagreement between the Arab elite families.
	
By contrast, let's look at the Jewish community.
	- They were much more active.
	- Van Guerian
		* We shall fight the war against Hitler as if there were no White Paper. We shall fight the White Paper as if there were no war.
		* Nazi Germany is a huge threat, and the British are a huge ally. They admit that.
		* They do acknowledge, however, that the British are preventing them from getting a national home in Palestine.
	- Face an uphill battle.
		* British are more powerful than the Zionists and the Arabs (militarily).
		* Caps on immigration set by the White Paper were for the most part - successful.
	- The Last Jew in Vinnitsa - massacred by the Germans in the Ukraine.
	- One way that Palestinian Zionists got past the immigration caps is by provisioning their own vessels under the cover of dark trading into Europe.
		* Worked periodically - stories of thousands of Jewish immigrants being dumped onto mandate Palestine.
		* Also failed sometimes.
		* In 1940, Jewish forces planted a bomb on a ship called SS Patria - 1700 illegal immigrants.
			- Bomb went off, 200 jews died.
	- There was, hence, a lot of anxiety in the Zionist community.
	- Caused the nature of leadership in the Jewish community to change.
	- Biltmore Hotel
		* Zionist conference that declared a bunch of pro-Israel stuff.
		* Very straightforward. Appeals to democracy.
	- Irgun - emergence of Zionist terrorism.
		* a lot of British hate because of the White Paper.
		* Revisionist Zionist - Vladimir Jabot....sky founded this organization Irgun.
		* direct response to the Great Revolt.
		* Most saw Nazism as a greater threat than the Arabs/British.
		* a group of radicals seceded into the Stern Gang
			- was willing to ally with Germany/Italy to fuck the British.
			- was killed by the British though.
		* Jabotensky was replaced by >Bagun< (later become Israeli PM) sometime in 1940s 
	- Jews didn't get far politically by trying to work with the British. So they changed tactics in 1943.
	- By 1945, they hadn't changed British policy or achieved anything politically.
		* their position, however, became much more sympathetic.
		* paramilitary campaign
		* Zionist orgs united to cause British to send additional military forces to crush Zionist revolt.
		* steady escalating pressure on the British even after the conclusion of the war.
	- Americans decided that the suffering of European Jews could be ameliorated by allowing a million more Jews to go into Palestine immediately.
		* felt guilty about the Holocaust.
		* Truman wrote to the British directly to allow the refugees to immigrate.
		* British didn't quite like the idea.
			- They figured that more Jews would destabilize the region even more - piss off Arabs. Give more jews to zionist groups.
			- Don't want to undermine their own authority - White Paper.
			- a sense of exhaustion in the British civilians.
			- By obstructing this problem, they wanted the Americans to take over the mandate problem.
			- Bombing of King David Hotel
				* British flooded Tel Aviv, and fucked shit up.

Leaving of the British created a political vacuum in Palestine.

Zionists were a lot more organized and coordinated than the Arabs were.
	- Ben Gurion declared creation of Isreal in May 1948.
	- The next day, Truman shocked everyone by recognizing Israel.
		* HUGE DEAL - Gave Ben Gurion political backing.
	- The same day, Syria, Jordan, and Egypt launched armies into Israel starting the War for Israeli Independence.
		* This was monumental in setting the stage for the 20th century.
		* Catastrophic for Arab-Palestinian relationship.
