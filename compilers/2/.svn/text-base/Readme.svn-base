------------------------------------------------------------------------
The script rec.py recursively parses a simple context free grammar and generates ILOC code for it.

There is no compilation step required for this script on the iLab machines.

The program takes in the input string as a command line argument. For Example:

./rec.py 'a=3;b=1;c=2;!a;!b;!c.'

loadI   1020 => r0 //for printing purposes
loadI   3 => r1
loadI   1 => r2
loadI   2 => r3
store   r1 => r0 
output  1020 
store   r2 => r0 
output  1020 
store   r3 => r0 
output  1020 

The generated ILOC Code, and any parse errors are printed to stdout. You can use the command below to immediately run the ILOC code generated by the parser.

./rec.py 'a=3;b=1;c=2;!a;!b;!c' | /path/to/simulator 

If for any reason, the command ./rec.py does not work (this may happen due to discrepancies in the version of Python installed). You can replace it with the command "python rec.py".
