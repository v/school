CS 415 - Compilers - Register Allocation Project

This code runs on python versions between 2 and 3 (tested on 2.4 and 2.6)

There is one source file parse_iloc.py. 

The program takes in inputs through command line arguments.
python parse_iloc.py <input iloc file> <allocation scheme> <number of total register>

It prints out the resulting iloc code onto stdout.

Allocation Scheme can be one of the following:
0 - Top Down Allocation (No consideration of Live Ranges)
1 - Top Down Allocation (Consideration of Live Ranges. Longest live range spilled upon conflict)
2 - Bottom Up Allocation (Furthest use in the future is the register spilled.)
